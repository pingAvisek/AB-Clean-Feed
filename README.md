# AB Clean Feed (open-source)

We all read the news online these days on various web portals, but the Nepali news portal has a lot of local advertisements that ad-blockers like AdGuard cannot remove.
Therefore, I have developed a Google Chrome extension using basic JavaScriptÂ that may prevent the local adverts on the Nepali News Portal.
